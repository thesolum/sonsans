# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview

We’re building a mobile recipe application that helps home cooks discover, save, and share delicious recipes in one clean, modern interface. Leveraging the visual style guidelines defined in the `sonsans` design documentation, our goal is to translate those design tokens (color palette, typography, elevation, border-radius) into a responsive React Native app. This app solves the problem of scattered recipe sources and inconsistent user experiences by offering a single, beautifully designed platform for recipe browsing and management.

This first version focuses on core recipe browsing workflows: discovering new dishes, viewing detailed instructions, marking favorites, and searching/filtering recipes. Success criteria include: delivering a polished UI matching the design spec, sub-2-second screen loads on mid-range devices, and stable basic CRUD operations for recipe data. We’ll measure adoption via user sign-ups and retention through repeat engagement with saved recipes.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

### In-Scope (Version 1.0)
- Implementation of UI components per `sonsans` design tokens (colors, typography, shadows, border-radius)
- Home feed screen displaying recipe cards (image, title, short description)
- Recipe detail screen (ingredients list, step-by-step instructions, nutrition facts)
- Search and filter functionality (by keyword, category)
- Favorites management (add/remove recipes)
- User authentication (email/password, Google)
- Offline caching of viewed recipes
- Basic profile screen (view/display saved recipes)
- Integration with a public recipe API (e.g., Spoonacular) or simple mock backend

### Out-of-Scope (Version 1.0)
- In-app meal planner or calendar
- Social sharing beyond simple share links
- Push notifications
- In-app purchases or subscription management
- Advanced user profiles (social feed, comments)
- Native tablet/adaptive layouts beyond basic scaling

## 3. User Flow

When a new user opens the app, they’re prompted to sign up or continue as guest. After authentication, they land on the Home feed: a vertically scrollable list of recipe cards styled with pastel orange accents and Poppins typography. Each card shows a hero image, recipe name, and a brief description. A persistent bottom navigation bar provides quick access to Home, Search, Favorites, and Profile.

Tapping a recipe card opens the Recipe Detail screen. Here, the user can swipe through step-by-step instructions, view ingredient checklists, and tap the heart icon to add to Favorites. From any screen, users can switch to Search, enter keywords or select filters (e.g., vegetarian, quick meals), then browse results. The Favorites tab lists saved recipes for offline viewing. Lastly, the Profile tab lets users review their account details and sign out.

## 4. Core Features

- **Design System Implementation**: Translate design tokens (colors, typography, shadows, border-radius scales) into a React Native StyleSheet or styled-components theme.
- **Authentication**: Email/password signup & login; Google OAuth.
- **Home Feed**: Recipe card list with infinite scroll.
- **Recipe Detail**: Full-screen view with ingredients, steps, nutrition, and Favorites toggle.
- **Search & Filters**: Keyword search, category filters; real-time suggestions.
- **Favorites**: Add/remove recipes; persistent local storage and cloud sync.
- **Offline Caching**: Cache last-viewed recipes and images for offline access.
- **Profile Screen**: View account info, list of saved recipes, sign out.
- **Data Integration**: Fetch recipe data from an external API or a lightweight backend service.

---

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

- **Frontend**: React Native (TypeScript) with Expo or bare workflow
- **Styling**: styled-components or Tailwind CSS-compatible RN library; design tokens imported via a JSON theme
- **Backend/Data**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth) or Node.js + Express + MongoDB
- **API**: External recipe API (e.g., Spoonacular) or mock endpoints using JSON Server
- **State Management**: React Query for data fetching & caching; Context API for theme/auth
- **AI Models/Libraries**: Optional GPT-4 via OpenAI API for recipe suggestions (future phase)
- **IDE & Plugins**: VS Code with Windsurf extension for design-token sync; Cursor for AI-assisted coding snippets

---

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Screens must render within 300ms of data availability; full navigation transitions under 500ms. App startup under 2s on mid-range devices.
- **Security**: Encrypt user credentials in transit (HTTPS) and at rest. Follow OWASP Mobile Top 10 guidelines.
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance for text contrast, touch target sizes (minimum 44x44pt), and screen-reader labels.
- **Scalability**: Leverage pagination/infinite scroll to handle large recipe sets.
- **Reliability**: Offline caching to cover transient network failures; retry logic for API calls.

---

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

- We assume the `sonsans` design tokens file is complete and versioned in the repo.
- We depend on availability of a public recipe API (rate limits may apply).
- Target platforms are iOS 12+ and Android 8+; no tablet-specific layouts in v1.
- Supabase (or chosen backend) provides 99.9% uptime SLA.
- User authentication will not integrate enterprise SSO in v1.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

- **API Rate Limits**: Public recipe APIs often limit requests. Mitigation: implement client-side caching and local database fallback.
- **Incomplete Design Specs**: If any design token is missing, UI may drift. Mitigation: flag missing tokens early and stub defaults in code.
- **Network Variability**: Rendering high-resolution recipe images can be slow. Mitigation: use progressive image loading and placeholders.
- **Authentication Edge Cases**: Social login errors or email verification delays. Mitigation: provide clear error messages and retry options.
