# App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a brand-new user first opens the app, they arrive at a welcome screen that briefly explains the recipe discovery experience and offers two clear choices: sign up or continue as a guest. If the user taps the sign-up button, they are taken to an account creation page where they can register with their email address and a chosen password. On this page, the user enters their name, email, and password, and then taps a confirmation button to submit the information. The app displays a loader while it communicates with the authentication server, and upon success, sends the user to the main home screen. If the user prefers, they can instead tap a Google sign-in option, which opens a Google authentication flow. After the user consents with their Google account, the app registers or signs them in automatically and takes them to the home screen. In the event of a forgotten password, the user can select a “Forgot Password” link on the login page. They then enter their registered email address and tap a button to receive a password reset email. Once they follow the link in their inbox to set a new password, they return to the login screen to access their account. A user may also choose to continue as a guest without signing in. In this case, they can explore recipes in a limited way but are prompted to sign up or log in before saving favorites. A sign-out option is available in the profile section so that any signed-in user can securely log out and return to the welcome screen.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

Immediately after signing in or continuing as a guest, the user lands on the Home feed screen. This screen has a clean, modern look with pastel orange accents and uses the Poppins font for titles and body text. The main area displays a vertically scrollable list of recipe cards, each showing a hero image, the recipe name, and a short description. At the bottom of the screen, a persistent navigation bar offers four icons labeled Home, Search, Favorites, and Profile. At the top, a subtle header shows the app logo and a small search icon for quick access to the search screen. The user can scroll through the feed endlessly thanks to infinite scroll, and tapping any recipe card transports them to the Recipe Detail screen. The bottom bar remains visible as they move between core sections of the app.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

When the user taps a recipe card on the Home feed, the app transitions with a smooth animation to the Recipe Detail screen. In this view, the recipe title appears in large bold text at the top, followed by a carousel of images. Below the images, the user sees a list of ingredients with checkboxes and a step-by-step instruction section they can scroll through. A heart icon floats in the top right corner of the screen. If the user taps the heart, it fills in to indicate that the recipe has been added to their Favorites. If they tap it again, it unfavorites. On this screen, a back arrow in the header returns the user to the Home feed or previous screen.

If the user taps the Search icon in the bottom navigation, they go to the Search screen. A search bar sits at the top where they type keywords. As they type, the app suggests matching recipes in real time. Below the search bar, filter tabs let the user pick categories such as vegetarian or quick meals. When they enter a term or apply filters, the results appear in a grid of recipe cards. They can scroll and tap any result to go to that recipe’s detail page.

When the user wants to see all their saved recipes, they tap the Favorites icon in the bottom bar. This opens a list of recipe cards similar to the Home feed but showing only those the user has favorited. From there, they can tap a card to view details. The Favorites screen works offline by relying on locally cached recipe data, so the user can still browse saved recipes even without an active connection.

Finally, tapping the Profile icon brings the user to the Profile screen. Here they see their display name and email address at the top. Below that is a section titled Saved Recipes, which duplicates the Favorites list. At the bottom of the profile view, a Sign Out button logs the user out and returns them to the welcome screen. If the user tapped Sign Out by mistake, a confirmation dialog asks them to confirm before signing them out.

## Settings and Account Management

Inside the Profile screen, the user can update their personal information by tapping an Edit Profile button. This opens a form where they can change their display name and upload a new avatar photo. After making changes, the user taps Save and the app updates their profile picture and name both locally and on the server. If the app offered notification preferences, those would appear here as toggle switches, letting the user opt in to newsletters or recipe suggestions. The user exits the settings by tapping a back arrow, which takes them back to the Profile screen. From there, they can resume browsing the Home feed or any other section via the bottom navigation.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

If the user enters invalid login credentials during sign in, the app displays a clear error message in red just below the form explaining that the email or password is incorrect. The password field is cleared for security, and the user can retry. In the sign-up flow, if the email is already in use, a similar message advises the user to choose another email or log in instead. During password reset, if the email is not found, the app informs the user that no account matches the address.

If the app loses network connectivity while browsing recipes, it shows a small banner at the top stating "No internet connection" and allows access to previously cached recipe details. Attempts to fetch new recipes or perform searches simply display a retry button. If the user taps the retry button once connectivity returns, the app automatically reloads the feed or search results. When a server error occurs during actions like adding to Favorites, the app briefly shows a toast message saying "Action failed. Please try again." and the heart icon reverts to its prior state.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

From the moment the user opens the app, they are guided through a friendly welcome screen into a clean, image-driven Home feed. New users choose to sign up or explore as guests, then enjoy a seamless browsing experience that highlights beautiful recipe cards. With a single tap, they dive into detailed cooking instructions, add favorites for later, and stay within a familiar bottom navigation layout. Searching for new dishes or filtering by category feels fast and intuitive, while saving recipes offers offline access. Account management remains unobtrusive yet powerful, letting users update their details or sign out. Throughout, clear error messages and retry options keep the experience smooth, ensuring that cooking inspiration is always just a tap away.
